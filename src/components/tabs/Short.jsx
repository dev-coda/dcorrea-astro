        I was born and raised in Medell√≠n, Colombia. I started coding at age 8
        on an old Windows 3.1 machine with BASIC.{" "}

        After high school, I studied Chemical Engineering on two of the top
        Universities in the country. I had a brief career in the chemical
        industry, before I decided to transition into development full time.{" "}

        I have completed thousands of hours of online material, in several
        platforms, from Bootcamps to Masterclasses. I'm a proud follower of the
        resources by Wes Bos, Kent C. Dodds and Brad Traversy. In the way I
        acquired a lot of experience in Wordpress and the LAMP/LEMP Stack,
        including php theme and plugin development.

        I'm currently working on Jamstack and the MERN Stack, and I'm specially
        interested in applications in Headless CMS and as a Front end for modern
        REST or GraphQL based CMS. I'm well acquainted with Next.js, Gatsby.js
        and lately Astro.build, as I develop a well rounded stack capable of
        tackling simple to complex projects, from Wordpress to blazingly fast
        SPA and Jamstack MPA.
