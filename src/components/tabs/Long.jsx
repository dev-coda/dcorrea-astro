        I was born and raised in Medell√≠n, Colombia. I started coding at age 8
        on an old Windows 3.1 machine with BASIC. Even then, I was learning IF's
        and GOTO's from old Commodore magazines found in my school's library.

        At the time, I wrote simple games mostly, and a few rogue-ish text
        adventures. As I got interested in programming, my supportive family got
        me an expensive course on CD-ROMs, where I would learn Borland Delphi.
        Not specially enjoyable.
      </p>

        After that, I got really into Free Software, ever since I got a Ubuntu
        LiveCD on the mail. I tried a lot of distros, ran GNU/Linux daily for
        most of my life and even contributed to some projects back in the day,
        using Subversion. That was my introduction to version control.

        After high school, I studied Chemical Engineering on two of the top
        Universities in the country. Through my career I always focused on
        programatic solutions, took every CS course they offered, and learned
        Matlab, GNU/Octave, some Python and a bit of C++. I had a brief career
        in the chemical industry, before I decided to transition into
        development full time.

        I have completed thousands of hours of online material, in several
        platforms, from Bootcamps to masterclasses. My favorite has to be Kent
        C. Dodds's "Epic React" and anything by Wes Bos. I still have a huge
        pile stuff to learn, but I'm always looking to make it bigger.

        After some time, I started taking freelance work, mostly simple sites
        and ecommerce websites on Wordpress and Woocommerce. In the way I
        acquired a lot of experience in basic graphic design, tools like Sketch,
        Figma, and AdobeXD, Wordpress and the LAMP/LEMP Stack, including php
        theme and plugin development. I'm currently working on Jamstack and the
        MERN Stack, and I'm specially interested in applications in Headless CMS
        and as a Front end for modern REST or GraphQL based CMS. I'm well
        acquainted with Next.js, Gatsby.js and lately Astro.build.
