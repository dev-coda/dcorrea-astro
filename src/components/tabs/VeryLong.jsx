        Well, ok. I hope you have some time to spare. I was born and raised in
        Medell√≠n, Colombia. I started coding at age 8 on an old Windows 3.1
        machine with BASIC. Even then, I was learning IF's and GOTO's from old
        Commodore magazines found in my school's library. I remember I once made
        some sort of Dungeon Crawler, spent weeks imagining and planning. It was
        absurdly ambitious. I barely got 3 or 4 screens coded. That was a first
        lesson in understanding the scope of a project and the budget required.
        By the way, there's no reason to be reading this. It's way too long.

        At the time, I wrote simple games mostly, and a few rogue-ish text
        adventures. As I got interested in programming, my supportive family got
        me an expensive course on CD-ROMs, where I would learn Borland Delphi.
        It was pretty bad. Safe to say, I lost interest as a teenager. Also I
        got into music. I played bass (badly), guitar (ok I guess), and even
        sang (horrificly) for a few bands.

        After that, I got really into Free Software, since I got a Ubuntu LiveCD
        on the mail. I tried a lot of distros, ran GNU/Linux daily for most of
        my life and even contributed to some projects back in the day, using
        Subversion. That was my introduction to version control. I also made
        some graphic themes for GNOME and KDE. Used to have this crazy
        Compiz-Fusion desktop full of effects, and a Conky system monitor
        telling me all of the useless info my computer could monitor.

        After high school, I studied Chemical Engineering on two of the top
        Universities in the country. Through my career I always focused on
        programatic solutions, took every CS course they offered, and learned
        Matlab, GNU/Octave, some Python and a bit of C++. I had a brief career
        in the chemical industry, before I decided to transition into
        development full time. My first CS assignment was writing a simple
        madlibs program. We were using a specific editor, with specific obsolete
        libraries for some function. Those didn't have linux versions. I got a
        3.2 (C- I guess) because I didn't use those libraries and used Eclipse
        instead of the abandonware editor the course required. As my first foray
        into "college level" programming, I was pretty dissapointed, and decided
        to focus my professional career on process optimization.

        I have completed thousands of hours of online material, in several
        platforms, from Bootcamps to masterclasses. My favorite has to be Kent
        C. Dodds's "Epic React" and anything my Wes Bos. I still have a huge
        pile stuff to learn. I have a course addiction. I often do projects that
        cover stuff I have done before just because I wat that dev's version of
        the material. It's sad most of the material is somewhat outdated, and as
        I grow as a developer, I find myself relying less on instructional
        content, and more on documentation (and Stack Overflow of course).

        After some time, I started taking freelance work, mostly simple sites
        and ecommerce websites on Wordpress and Woocommerce. In the way I
        acquired a lot of experience in basic graphic design, tools like Sketch,
        Figma, and AdobeXD, and Wordpress and the LAMP/LEMP Stack, including php
        theme and plugin development. I'm currently working on the MERN Stack,
        and I'm specially interested in applications in Headless CMS and as a
        Front end for modern REST or GraphQL based CMS.I'm well acquainted with
        Next.js, Gatsby.js and lately Astro.build. Well, if you truly read all
        of this wall of text, let me tell you, it was done as a joke, and a bad
        one, at that. It was not worth it. I told you.
